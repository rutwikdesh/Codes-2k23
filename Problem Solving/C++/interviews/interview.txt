I'd be happy to share a bit about myself. I'm currently working at Quantiphi as a software engineer and have total working experience of 1.8 years. I am proficient in Java, Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming. During my tenure at Quantiphi, I had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies and frameworks, including Spring Boot, Hibernate, SQL, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
I am a team player and I am always ready to take on reponsibilites.
Apart from my techincal side, I'm a passionate hiker and an avid cricket enthusiast.
I'm really excited about discussing how I can bring my skills and enthusiasm to your organization.
